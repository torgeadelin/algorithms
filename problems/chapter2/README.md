# Interview Problems from Cracking the Code Interview

## Chapter 2 - Linked Lists

### 1. [Remove Dups](./RemoveDups.java)

Remove Dups! Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
FOLLOW UP
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

### 2. [Return Kth to Last](./KthToLast.java)

Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

### 3. [Delete Middle Node](./DeleteMiddle.java)

Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
EXAMPLE
**Input:** the node c from the linked list `a->b->c->d->e->f`
**Result:** nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like `a->b->d->e->f`
