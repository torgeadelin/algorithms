# Interview Problems from Cracking the Code Interview

## Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

### 1. [IsUnique](./Unique.java)

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

### 2. [Check Permutation](./Permutation.java)

Given two strings,write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

### 3.[URLify](./URLify.java)

URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java,please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE

Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13 Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
