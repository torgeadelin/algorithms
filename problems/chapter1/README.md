# Interview Problems from Cracking the Code Interview

## Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

### 1. [IsUnique](./Unique.java)

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

### 2. [Check Permutation](./CheckPermutation.java)

Given two strings,write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

### 3.[URLify](./URLify.java)

URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java,please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE

**Input**: "Mr John Smith ", 13 Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

### 4. [Palindrom Permutation](./PalindromPermutation.java)

Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

EXAMPLE

**Input**: Tact Coa
**Output**: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
